# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
Implementation of some of the Fundamental Algorithms in Machine Learning from scratch using Numpy


1. **bayes** - Implementation of `naive bayes algorithm` for classification of mail as spam or non-spam and classifiying a pixel 
belonging to river or non-river part of the image.

2. **faces** - Implementation of `Principal Component Analysis` and `Linear Discriminant Analysis` for face recognition.

3. **fuzzy** - Implementation of `fuzzy logic` (using skfuzzy, this folder is an outlier).

4. **logistic** - Implementation of `Logistic Regression`. Tested on Exam and Microchip Dataset. 

5. **newtons** - Implementation of `newtons optimisation algorithm` for classification problem. Ran the algorithm on same
datasests as logistic.

6. **regression** -  Implementation of `Linear Regression with Gradient Descent`, `Locally weighted Regression` and `Normal
Equation method` for regression problem. Used housing price dataset for testing.

7. **svm** - Implementation of `Support Vector Machine` algorithm. Used `MNIST` dataset for testing.
